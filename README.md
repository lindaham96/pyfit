# pyfit
Workout tracking app in Django

To explore the app, sign up at py-fit.com/signup. Currently the dashboard just says "woot, dashboard!" as a placeholder, but you can explore the routine views manually by goign to py-fit.com/routines/ after logging in. From here you can create routines and add exercises. The only available choices for exercises in the Name field and Type field are 'BENCH_PRESS' or 'OVERHEAD_PRESS' for name and 'RESISTANCE' for type. I'll add more later, and make the inputs into dropdowns. It's on my To Do list. 

Full disclaimer, I'm not a designer...
